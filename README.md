In this repository you can find my analysis about the inclusion or not of a set of symbol in the yet not deciphered cretan hieroglyph language. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_hieroglyphs for a very quick introduction. More information can be found in the bibliography.

In the repository you can find the .Rmd file used to do all the analysis and the .md file that show the results. The .csv file contains the data used in the analysis. The different folders contains files used to build the final file.

I thank for the help in informatizing and perparing the data Adriano Fragomeni, Eleonora Grassucci, Livia Biggi and Riccardo Gobbo.
